## **To run the model**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - First, clone the repository containing your movie recommendation system code to your local machine. You can do this using Git or by downloading the ZIP file from the repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
   - Install the necessary Python libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   - In the same terminal or command prompt, execute the following command to run the Streamlit app:
     ```
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - This will start the local development server, and you'll see a message indicating that the app is running.
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8501` (or the URL provided in the terminal) to access the interactive web app.

4. **Select a Movie**:
   - On the Streamlit app, you'll find a search bar where you can either select a movie from the dropdown list or type the movie name.
   - Choose a movie for which you want to receive recommendations.

5. **View Recommendations**:
   - Click the "Show Recommendation" button.
   - The app will display recommended movies based on the selected input movie. You'll see movie posters and titles for the top recommendations.
